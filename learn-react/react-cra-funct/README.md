# React application using functional style
This project was created with `create-react-app` which is developed by Facebook. It will provide the boiler-plate code for basic react application with webpack, babel-loader and other required asset loaders. So, the developer can only focus on the development by ignoring the steps of bundling the project.

### Install the Node in your system
1. Download the Node from the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) official website and simply install the `msi` or `unzip` the downloaded archieve files and start using the same.
2. Or, Follow the instuction from the [installation steps](https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac) to install the same.

Once the `Node` was installed then use the `node -v` and `npm -v` commmand from the terminal to make sure the installation done correctly.

Once the `Node` was installed then create the react application using `create-react-app` then we need to execute the `npx create-react-app <project_name>` command will create the react application for you.

The all required assets has to added to the `public` folder of the projec repository then modify the `index.html` to add the required stylesheet configuration in it. The `App.js` in the src folder is the entry file so, you can start modify the code from there.
